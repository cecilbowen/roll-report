/: nevermind
x: done

want to get done:
------------------
x ability to click on perks from all perks section to exclude combos with that perk from showing in the combo results
    - better visually indicate to the user this is happening
x make mobile UI work/look better overall
    x modal bad on mobile 
    / alternative options placement
x add loading spinner to modal when fetching dim query
x make sure UI in general is display-size agnostic (dynamic)
    - perk bubble size scale with display size (relative to wallpaper)
    / update when to show scroll indicator arrows
    x loading screen if waiting on buildWeaponIndex
x implement Bungie Login to allow non-public vault checks
    - detect if user uses the bungie name fetch while already logged in and with own name;
      if true, then it should pull inv as if they hit the "Bungie Login"/"Get Rolls"
- add more server logging
- figure out what made an authorized /me inventory fetch pull only public gear that one time
x add query param for initial page weapon so links can be shared
x dim modal input validator
x ammo type filter
x add new gear filter 
x figure out origin trait addition
    x maybe separate "tab" (grayed-out text next to "Unique Perk Combos") to show all origin trait + single perk unique combos
x show combo amount in parenthesis next to "tab" name
x add weapon icon watermarks
x update background color behind wallpaper and app::after fade to match (close) to wallpaper gradient
x unify search panel weapon icon element icon positions
- if was on tab with results, then filtered out a perk, app should swap to origin perk tab if it has results (if only one tab with results, swap to it)
- arrow keys to move through guns in search panel quicker
- ENTER functionality on modal input
- make dim export take user's filter into account, but also update message in modal to notify user this will happen
- add last tool updated date as a title attribute when hovering on the version text 


code-related cleanup:
----------------------
- change some of the backend throws into better error handling than just "oops, error, crash the backend!"
x run buildWeaponIndex on backend start, not first client connect
- separate App.js into different components
    x search results panel 
    x options 
    - perk combos 
    - selected weapon 
x re-enable eslint (still in top-level folder, instead of inside both client and server)
