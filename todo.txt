x: done

want to get done:
------------------
- make mobile UI work/look better overall
    x modal bad on mobile 
    / alternative options placement
- make sure UI in general is display-size agnostic (dynamic)
    - perk bubble size scale with display size (relative to wallpaper)
    / update when to show scroll indicator arrows
    x loading screen if waiting on buildWeaponIndex
- implement Bungie Login to allow non-public vault checks
    - detect if user uses the bungie name fetch while already logged in and with own name;
      if true, then it should pull inv as if they hit the "Bungie Login"/"Get Rolls"
- add more server logging
- figure out what /me inventory fetch pull only public gear that one time
x add query param for initial page weapon so links can be shared
x dim modal input validator
x ammo type filter
x add new gear filter 
x figure out origin trait addition
    x maybe separate "tab" (grayed-out text next to "Unique Perk Combos") to show all origin trait + single perk unique combos
x show combo amount in parenthesis next to "tab" name
x add weapon icon watermarks
x update background color behind wallpaper and app::after fade to match (close) to wallpaper gradient
x unify search panel weapon icon element icon positions
- arrow keys to move through guns in search panel quicker
- ENTER functionality on modal input
- make dim export take user's filter into account, but also update message in modal to notify user this will happen


code-related cleanup:
----------------------
- change some of the backend throws into better error handling than just "oops, error, crash the backend!"
x run buildWeaponIndex on backend start, not first client connect
- separate App.js into different components
x re-enable eslint (still in top-level folder, instead of inside both client and server)
